# Advanced GAN - Faces Generated using GANs

This repository contains the code and resources for generating realistic faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on the CELEBA dataset. The CELEBA dataset is a large-scale face attributes dataset consisting of more than 200,000 celebrity images. 

## Dataset

The CELEBA dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link: [CELEBA Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset)

Please make sure to place the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.0 or higher)
- Keras (2.3 or higher)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
